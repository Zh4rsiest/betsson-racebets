    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Who can take part?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">The promotion is available for new and existing customers with registered RaceBets accounts, aged 18 or over.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How and when can I qualify?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Customers will qualify to play on receipt of a token which will be issued through the following methods:</p>

    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Once a customer has cumulatively staked £/€25 a token will be issued. A customer can only hold one token at any one time. Stakes made once a game is in progress will not contribute towards future tokens</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Customers can qualify for a token through ad hoc promotions from RaceBets</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How do I Play?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You are given a pot of £/€1,000,000 and have 20 questions to answer. On each question you must either split your pot or put all of your pot on one answer.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Once a question has been resulted any money put on the winning answer will move on to the next question.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You will then repeat this process until you have answered all 20 questions, any money remaining after the 20th and last question has been resulted is yours to keep.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">What can I win?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">The maximum winnings from any single is £/€1,000,000.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">When will I get my prize?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Cash will be credited to your account within 48 hours.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Other game rules</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">This is a Sportsbook (i.e. a fixed odds) product.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Tickets hold no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Tickets are only valid for sixty days from the time you answered your first question. Should this time elapse prior to the game being completed in its entirety, you will be able to claim an amount calculated by halving the remaining pot for every question which remains. For example, if you have £/€200 remaining in your pot with 2 questions still to play, you will be entitled to £/€50 (because the remaining £/€200 will be halved to £/€100 for the first unanswered question and then halved again to £/€50 for the 2nd and final unanswered question). Please note that due to you allowing the game to lapse you will not be automatically credited with this amount and instead will need to contact our customer support team to claim.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Only one game can be played at any one time.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Winnings are returned in cash.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Markets are settled in accordance with The RaceBets Sportsbook Rules and Regulations which are available here.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">In the event of an incorrect result, RaceBets will cancel this result and re-settle the correct result.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Should a customer have already progressed past the question which was resulted incorrectly, they will be brought back to the stage of the game where they would have been, should the question have been settled correctly. For example, should a customer with £/€20,000 remaining on his 5th question split £15,000 on yes and £5,000 on no and the result be incorrectly settled as yes and the customer has already moved to question 7 with still £15,000 remaining, when the question has been resettled the customer will move back to question 6 with £5,000 remaining instead.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">In the event where a question must be voided (e.g. human error in question, big price movement, non-runners), RaceBets will void this question and all customers will have to answer a new question to progress.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-semibold leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">RaceBets has the right to suspend a question at any time, should this happen all customers who have played the question will be unable to edit their selection. All customers who have not confirmed their selection will be given a new question to answer at a later point.</p>
