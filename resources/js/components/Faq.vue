    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary"><b>Step 1:</b>Check if you have a ticket to play RaceBets Million, tickets will be issued when you have staked £25</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary"><b>Step 2:</b>You will be presented with your first question to answer, you can either split your pot or go all in on one answer, you then need to lock your answer. Once the question has been resulted, the money you placed on the correct answer will be available to be staked on the next question. You repeat this process until all the questions have been answered.</p>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary"><b>Step 3:</b>Any money left in the pot after all the questions have been answered is yours to keep.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Who can take part?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You must have a registered RaceBets account and be eligible for promotions and bonuses to take part</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How many questions do I need to answer?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">The number of questions you need to answer will be displayed when you play the game, typically this will be 20 questions.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">What is a pot?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Usually the “pot” is known as your potential winnings, however for the RaceBets Million we give you your potential winnings up front and it is your job to keep it.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">What happens if I do not answer a question in time?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You get sixty days to answer a question before the game ends. If you do not answer in this time, you will be entitled to claim an amount that is calculated by halving the pot (i.e. as it stands at the lapse of the sixty-day period) for every remaining question. For example, if you have £/€100 in the pot with two rounds to play, you will be entitled to claim £/€25 (because the remaining £/€100 will be notionally halved and the £/€50 which remains after that will then be notionally halved again). Please note that, because you have allowed the game to lapse, you will not automatically be credited with this amount but will be entitled to claim it by contacting our customer services team.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Do I answer questions one by one?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Yes, once the question you have answered has been resulted you will be able to answer the next question</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How much of my pot can I split?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You can split your pot between the 2 answers any way you wish, you can put all of the pot on one answer, known as “All In” or put money on both answers ensuring you will take some money through to the next question.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">What happens if I go ‘All In’ on one question?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">If you go all in, this means that if you pick the correct answer all of your pot will move on to the next question. If you are all in on the wrong answer you will have lost and be out of the game.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How are results settled?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Results are settled in accordance with our sportsbook rules.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Where can I see my previous answers?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">Previous answers can be found under “History” on The RaceBets Million page.</p>

    <h3 class="font-raleway text-lg font-semibold mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">How can I enter?</h3>
    <p class="text-xs font-medium leading-4 mb-2 dark:text-dark-text-primary">You will be able to enter RaceBets Million when you cumulatively stake £25. You can only play one game at any one time and the £25 staking requirement starts again once a game has finished.</p>
